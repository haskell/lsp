# This is a sample hie.yaml file for opening haskell-language-server
# in hie, using cabal as the build system.  To use is, copy it to a
# file called 'hie.yaml'
# WARNING: This configuration works for hie but does not for
#          haskell-language-server or ghcide.
#          They need support for multi-cradle:
