Parse a value optionally. This behaves similarly to 'J..:!' and
'J..:?', but differs in how it handles 'Null':

    * If 'Null' can be converted to the desired type...

        * 'J.:!': the result is success with 'Just <value>'
        * '.:!?': the result is success with 'Just <value>'
    * If 'Null' cannot be converted to the desired type...
        * 'J.:?': the result is success with 'Nothing'
        * 'J.:!': the result is failure
        * '.:!?': the result is success with 'Nothing'

That is, we allow 'Null' to mean either 'Nothing' or 'Just <value>',
with the latter taking priority.
