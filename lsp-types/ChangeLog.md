Instead of having TextDocumentEdit in WorkspaceEdit

```haskell
data WorkspaceEdit =
  WorkspaceEdit
    { _changes         :: Maybe WorkspaceEditMap
    , _documentChanges :: Maybe (List TextDocumentEdit)
    } deriving (Show, Read, Eq)
```
It is now replaced by a new type called DocumentChange

```haskell
data WorkspaceEdit =
  WorkspaceEdit
    { _changes         :: Maybe WorkspaceEditMap
    , _documentChanges :: Maybe (List DocumentChange)
    } deriving (Show, Read, Eq)
```
Which is just a synonym of union of WorkspaceEdit and other operations

```haskell
type DocumentChange = TextDocumentEdit |? CreateFile |? RenameFile |? DeleteFile
```
* Add new CodeAction features (isPreferred, disabled) (@pepeiborra)
* Respond to requests with missing handlers (@wz1000)
* Use Text over String in more places (@wz1000)
* Add missing lenses (@wz1000, @bubba)

## 1.0.0.0 -- 2020-10-15

1.0.0.0 is a major rework with both internal and external facing changes, and
will require manual migration.

* The package has been renamed from `haskell-lsp` to `lsp`, and similarly for `haskell-lsp-types` to `lsp-types`
  * Because of this, all modules are now exported from `Language.LSP.X` rather than `Language.Haskell.X`.
* Both `lsp` and `lsp-types` have been reworked to be much more *type safe*
* The 3.15 specification should be fully supported now. If you find anything in
  the specification that isn't in lsp-types, please let us know
* The Capture module has been removed as it will be reworked later on and moved to lsp-test
* `lsp` can now handle dynamic registration through the `registerCapability` and
  `unregisterCapability` functions

###Â Type safety
There are three types of concrete messages, `NotificationMessage`,
`RequestMessage` and `ResponseMessage`. They are parameterised by their
`Method`, which determines what type their parameters or response result must be.

```haskell
data RequestMessage (m :: Method f Request) = RequestMessage
    { _jsonrpc :: Text
    , _id      :: LspId m
    , _method  :: SMethod m
    , _params  :: MessageParams m
    }
```

A `Method` in turn is parameterised by whether it originates from the client or
the server, and whether it is used for notifications or requests:

```haskell
TextDocumentFoldingRange           :: Method FromClient Request
TextDocumentSelectionRange         :: Method FromClient Request
WindowShowMessage                  :: Method FromServer Notification
WindowShowMessageRequest           :: Method FromServer Request
```

Each `Method` also has a singleton counterpart which allows it to be used at the
term level, for example in `RequestMessage._method`:

```haskell
STextDocumentFoldingRange           :: SMethod TextDocumentFoldingRange
STextDocumentSelectionRange         :: SMethod TextDocumentSelectionRange

SWindowShowMessage                  :: SMethod WindowShowMessage
SWindowShowMessageRequest           :: SMethod WindowShowMessageRequest
```

The type families `MessageParams` and `ResponseResult` map each `Method` to the
appropriate type to be used in a response:

```haskell
ResponseResult TextDocumentRename            = WorkspaceEdit
ResponseResult TextDocumentPrepareRename     = Range |? RangeWithPlaceholder
```

Also new is the `|?` type which represents [union types in
TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#union-types),
and is used throughout the specification where a field can accept several
different types.

As an example of this in action, the types of your handlers will now depend on
whether or not they are a request or a notification. They will pass along the
precise type for the parameters the method you are handling, and in the case of
a request handler, will expect that the response you give back is of the correct
type as well.

```haskell
type family Handler (f :: Type -> Type) (m :: Method from t) = (result :: Type) | result -> f t m where
  Handler f (m :: Method _from Request)      = RequestMessage m -> (Either ResponseError (ResponseResult m) -> f ()) -> f ()
  Handler f (m :: Method _from Notification) = NotificationMessage m -> f ()
```

### LspT
`LspFuncs` has been removed and instead functionality is exposed through
functions in the `MonadLsp` class.

```haskell
getVirtualFile :: MonadLsp config m => NormalizedUri -> m (Maybe VirtualFile)
sendRequest :: forall (m :: Method FromServer Request) f config. MonadLsp config f
            => SServerMethod m
            -> MessageParams m
            -> (Either ResponseError (ResponseResult m) -> f ())
            -> f (LspId m)
```

It is parameterised over the server's LSP configuration type and the underlying
monad.
We recommend that you build your own monad for your server on top of the `LspT`
transformer, so it will automatically become an instance of `MonadLsp`.

Inside the new `ServerDefinition` data type which gets passed to `runServer`,
you need to specify how to convert from IO to your monad and back in
`interpretHandler` so that `lsp` can execute your monad inside the handlers. You
can use the result returned from `doInitialize` to pass along the
`LanguageContextEnv` needed to run an `LspT`, as well as anything else your
monad needs.
```haskell
type
ServerDefinition { ...
, doInitialize = \env _req -> pure $ Right env
, interpretHandler = \env -> Iso
   (runLspT env) -- how to convert from IO ~> m
   liftIO        -- how to convert from m ~> IO
}
```

### Steps to migrate

1. In your `.cabal` file change any `haskell-lsp` dependencies to `lsp`
2. Replace your existing imports with `Haskell.LSP.Server`
3. If necessary define your own monad and fill in `interpretHandler`
4. Migrate your handlers to use `notificationHandler` and `requestHandler`,
   passing along the corresponding `SMethod` (See `example/Simple.hs`)
5. Remove any storage/use of `LspFuncs` and instead call the corresponding
   functions directly from your monad instead of `IO`
