# Revision history for lsp

## 2.7.0.1 -- 2024-12-31

- Relax dependency version bounds

## 2.7.0.0 -- 2024-06-06

- Drop dependency on `uuid` and `random`
- Fix handling of `rootPath` in `intializeParams`
- Update to newer `lsp-types`

## 2.6.0.0

- Progress reporting now has a configurable start delay and update delay. This allows
  servers to set up progress reporting for any operation and not worry about spamming
  the user with extremely short-lived progress sessions.

## 2.5.0.0

- The server will now reject messages sent after `shutdown` has been received.
- There is a `shutdownBarrier` member in the server state which can be used to
  conveniently run actions when shutdown is triggered.

## 2.4.0.0

- Server-created progress now will not send reports until and unless the client 
  confirms the progress token creation.
- Progress helper functions now can take a progress token provided by the client, 
  so client-initiated progress can now be supported properly.
- The server options now allow the user to say whether the server should advertise
  support for client-initiated progress or not.
- The server now dynamically registers for `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` 
  notifications, to ensure that newer clients continue to send them.
- Removed `getCompletionPrefix` from the `VFS` module. This is specific to completing
  Haskell identifiers and doesn't belong here. It has already been moved to `ghcide`
  some time ago.

## 2.3.0.0

- Fix inference of server capabilities for newer methods (except notebook methods).
- VFS no longer requires IO to initialize, functions that wrote to a temporary directory
  now take the directory as an argument.

## 2.2.0.0

- Many changes relating to client configuration
    - `lsp` now sends `workspace/configuration` requests in response to `intialized` and
      `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` requests. It still attempts to parse configuration
      from `intializationOptions` and `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` as a fallback.
    - Servers must provide a configuration section for use in `workspace/configuration`.
    - `parseConfig` will now be called on the object corresponding to the configuration
      section, not the whole object.
    - New callback for when configuration changes, to allow servers to react.
- The logging of messages sent by the protocol has been disabled, as this can prove 
  troublesome for servers that log these to the client: https://github.com/haskell/lsp/issues/447

## 2.1.0.0

* Fix handling of optional methods.
* `staticHandlers` now takes the client capabilities as an argument. 
  These are static across the lifecycle of the server, so this allows
  a server to decide at construction e.g. whether to provide handlers
  for resolve methods depending on whether the client supports it.

## 2.0.0.0

* Support `lsp-types-2.0.0.0`.

## 1.6.0.0

* Pinned to lsp-types 1.6
* Tests moved to `lsp-types`

## 1.5.0.0

* VFS module moved to `lsp` from `lsp-types`.
* Logging reworked to use `co-log-core` instead of `hslogger`.

## 1.4.0.0

* Fix extraneous `asdf` in `withProgress` output (#372) (@heitor-lassarote)
* Use appropriate number types (#366) (@michaelpj)

## 1.2.0.1

* Add exception instances to LspT (#315) (@pepeiborra)
* Add call hierarchy support (@July541)
* Fix build on GHC 9 (@anka-213)
* pass the lspConfig at initialization time as well (@pepeiborra)
* Semantic token (@michaelpj)
* Do not crash on workspace/didChangeConfiguration (#321) (@strager)

## 1.2.0.0

* Parse config from initializeOptions and pass in the old value of config to onConfigurationChange (#285) (wz1000)
* Break up big TVar record into lots of small TVars (#286) (@wz1000)
* Add some INLINE pragmas (@wz1000)
* Make method equality work for CustomMethods (@wz1000)

## 1.1.1.0

* Don't send begin progress notification twice (@wz1000)

## 1.1.0.0

* Fix prepareRename reponse and prepareProvider (@kirelagin)
* Fix deriving instance of MonadUnliftIO (@banacorn)
* Add support for file and folder operations in WorkspaceEdit (@banacorn)
Instead of having TextDocumentEdit in WorkspaceEdit

```haskell
data WorkspaceEdit =
  WorkspaceEdit
    { _changes         :: Maybe WorkspaceEditMap
    , _documentChanges :: Maybe (List TextDocumentEdit)
    } deriving (Show, Read, Eq)
```
It is now replaced by a new type called DocumentChange

```haskell
data WorkspaceEdit =
  WorkspaceEdit
    { _changes         :: Maybe WorkspaceEditMap
    , _documentChanges :: Maybe (List DocumentChange)
    } deriving (Show, Read, Eq)
```
Which is just a synonym of union of WorkspaceEdit and other operations

```haskell
type DocumentChange = TextDocumentEdit |? CreateFile |? RenameFile |? DeleteFile
```
* Add new CodeAction features (isPreferred, disabled) (@pepeiborra)
* Respond to requests with missing handlers (@wz1000)
* Use Text over String in more places (@wz1000)
* Add missing lenses (@wz1000, @bubba)

## 1.0.0.0

1.0.0.0 is a major rework with both internal and external facing changes, and
will require manual migration.

* The package has been renamed from `haskell-lsp` to `lsp`, and similarly for `haskell-lsp-types` to `lsp-types`
  * Because of this, all modules are now exported from `Language.LSP.X` rather than `Language.Haskell.X`.
* Both `lsp` and `lsp-types` have been reworked to be much more *type safe*
* The 3.15 specification should be fully supported now. If you find anything in
  the specification that isn't in lsp-types, please let us know
* The Capture module has been removed as it will be reworked later on and moved to lsp-test
* `lsp` can now handle dynamic registration through the `registerCapability` and
  `unregisterCapability` functions

###Â Type safety

There are three types of concrete messages, `NotificationMessage`,
`RequestMessage` and `ResponseMessage`. They are parameterised by their
`Method`, which determines what type their parameters or response result must be.

```haskell
data RequestMessage (m :: Method f Request) = RequestMessage
    { _jsonrpc :: Text
    , _id      :: LspId m
    , _method  :: SMethod m
    , _params  :: MessageParams m
    }
```

A `Method` in turn is parameterised by whether it originates from the client or
the server, and whether it is used for notifications or requests:

```haskell
TextDocumentFoldingRange           :: Method FromClient Request
TextDocumentSelectionRange         :: Method FromClient Request
WindowShowMessage                  :: Method FromServer Notification
WindowShowMessageRequest           :: Method FromServer Request
```

Each `Method` also has a singleton counterpart which allows it to be used at the
term level, for example in `RequestMessage._method`:

```haskell
STextDocumentFoldingRange           :: SMethod TextDocumentFoldingRange
STextDocumentSelectionRange         :: SMethod TextDocumentSelectionRange

SWindowShowMessage                  :: SMethod WindowShowMessage
SWindowShowMessageRequest           :: SMethod WindowShowMessageRequest
```

The type families `MessageParams` and `ResponseResult` map each `Method` to the
appropriate type to be used in a response:

```haskell
ResponseResult TextDocumentRename            = WorkspaceEdit
ResponseResult TextDocumentPrepareRename     = Range |? RangeWithPlaceholder
```

Also new is the `|?` type which represents [union types in
TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#union-types),
and is used throughout the specification where a field can accept several
different types.

As an example of this in action, the types of your handlers will now depend on
whether or not they are a request or a notification. They will pass along the
precise type for the parameters the method you are handling, and in the case of
a request handler, will expect that the response you give back is of the correct
type as well.

```haskell
type family Handler (f :: Type -> Type) (m :: Method from t) = (result :: Type) | result -> f t m where
  Handler f (m :: Method _from Request)      = RequestMessage m -> (Either ResponseError (ResponseResult m) -> f ()) -> f ()
  Handler f (m :: Method _from Notification) = NotificationMessage m -> f ()
```

### LspT
`LspFuncs` has been removed and instead functionality is exposed through
functions in the `MonadLsp` class.

```haskell
getVirtualFile :: MonadLsp config m => NormalizedUri -> m (Maybe VirtualFile)
sendRequest :: forall (m :: Method FromServer Request) f config. MonadLsp config f
            => SServerMethod m
            -> MessageParams m
            -> (Either ResponseError (ResponseResult m) -> f ())
            -> f (LspId m)
```

It is parameterised over the server's LSP configuration type and the underlying
monad.
We recommend that you build your own monad for your server on top of the `LspT`
transformer, so it will automatically become an instance of `MonadLsp`.

Inside the new `ServerDefinition` data type which gets passed to `runServer`,
you need to specify how to convert from IO to your monad and back in
`interpretHandler` so that `lsp` can execute your monad inside the handlers. You
can use the result returned from `doInitialize` to pass along the
`LanguageContextEnv` needed to run an `LspT`, as well as anything else your
monad needs.
```haskell
type 
ServerDefinition { ...
, doInitialize = \env _req -> pure $ Right env
, interpretHandler = \env -> Iso 
   (runLspT env) -- how to convert from IO ~> m
   liftIO        -- how to convert from m ~> IO
}
```

### Steps to migrate

1. In your `.cabal` file change any `haskell-lsp` dependencies to `lsp`
2. Replace your existing imports with `Haskell.LSP.Server`
3. If necessary define your own monad and fill in `interpretHandler`
4. Migrate your handlers to use `notificationHandler` and `requestHandler`,
   passing along the corresponding `SMethod` (See `example/Simple.hs`)
5. Remove any storage/use of `LspFuncs` and instead call the corresponding
   functions directly from your monad instead of `IO`
